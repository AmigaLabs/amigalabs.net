AmigaLabs is a collaborative team of developers that work to bring updated development tools and applications to AmigaOS 4. It started by working on the WebKit port, but it grew to a broader set of goals, because of multiple dependencies.

The AmigaLabs team is working to accomplish the following goals:

- WebKit porting and maintenance
- Developing and maintaining a new open-source libc named clib4
- Updating the available adtools
- Updating the binutils

All the development we are doing is open source and can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/amigalabs)
